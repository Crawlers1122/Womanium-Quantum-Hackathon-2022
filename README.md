## Hackathon Challenges:
  ### 1. Quantum Hardware Education Challenge --> *by QWorld*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Quantum-Hardware-Education-Challenge---QWorld
  > Develop an interactive quantum hardware module for QWorld! QWorld currently offers the comprehensive Quantum Programming modules QBronze, QSilver and QNickel. In this challenge, you will expand the QWorld curriculum with an exciting interactive module on a hardware implementation of your choice: from superconducting qubits and Qiskit Metal to topological quantum computing.
  ### 2. Green Qupermarket (Quantum Focus) --> *by Deloitte*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Green-Qupermarket-Technical-Focus---Deloitte
  > The goal of the Green Qupermarket challenge is to analyze how quantum technology can optimize the energy consumption model of supermarkets in regard to its CO2 emissions. The challenge scenario features a supermarket, multiple electric vehicles, and various weather conditions. The energy management of the supermarket is to be optimized so that the total CO2 emission is minimal by using the green decentrally generated energy out of electric vehicles. The batteries of the electric vehicles can be used as additional storage capacity. Create a quantum algorithm, a quantum hybrid solution or a quantum inspired solution addressing the optimization of the utilization of electricity with respect to a minimum CO2 emission.
  ### 3. Green Qupermarket (Business Focus) --> *by Deloitte*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Green-Qupermarket-Business-Focus---Deloitte
  > The goal of the Green Qupermarket challenge is to analyze how quantum technology can optimize the energy consumption model of supermarkets in regard to its CO2 emissions. The challenge scenario features a supermarket, multiple electric vehicles, and various weather conditions. The energy management of the supermarket is to be optimized so that the total CO2 emission is minimal by using the green decentrally generated energy out of electric vehicles. The batteries of the electric vehicles can be used as additional storage capacity. Develop a price model for charging and discharging of electric vehicles taking into account  CO2 emissions and dependency of demand and supply on weather conditions, and develop a corresponding business model.
  ### 4. Digital-analog Variational Quantum Eigensolver --> *by IQM*
  https://github.com/iqm-finland/iqm-academy-womanium-hackathon-DAQC-VQE
  > This task is to develop a new VQE ansatz based on the digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) framework. The ansatz will combine analog evolution of the processor hamiltonian with single qubit gates placed at the right time intervals. The model has potential to be “more hardware efficient” than typical hardware efficient ansätze.
  ### 5. Random number generation using boson sampling --> *by ORCA Computing*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Random-number-generation-using-boson-sampling---ORCA-Computing
  > In this challenge, you will develop a true random number generator using boson sampling. You will develop a proof of concept algorithm using open-source quantum simulation packages, and then deploy your algorithm on real hardware available in the cloud.
  ### 6. World-class Quantum chemistry with TKET --> *by Quantinuum*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/World-class-Quantum-chemistry-with-TKET---Quantinuum
  > Your company builds hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and is interested in finding new ways for a cost-effective and compact hydrogen storage system. You are working in the research and development (R&D) department and are tasked to evaluate the feasibility to simulate the quantum state of a Lithium Hydride (LiH) molecule using a gate-based quantum device. Based on the known gate sets and the qubit coupling map, you are tasked to find the best quantum device currently available.
  ### 7. Quantum Natural Language Processing with lambeq --> *by Quantinuum*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Quantum-Natural-Language-Processing-with-lambeq---Quantinuum
  > Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) is a very young area of research aimed at designing and implementing NLP models that exploit certain quantum phenomena. One issue with current NLP systems is that it is impossible to predict their behavior accurately. The objective for the participants of this hackathon challenge is to get some familiarity with compositional models of natural language running on quantum hardware. Can QNLP offer the possibility to build interpretable systems?
  ### 8. Quantum approximate optimisation algorithms for real-world scenarios --> *by Strangeworks*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Quantum-approximate-optimisation-algorithms-for-real-world-scenarios---Strangeworks
  > Current era noisy quantum devices may be well suited to solving quantum approximate optimisation algorithms (QAOA) which are extremely relevant to real world scenarios. As time on a quantum computer is currently extremely expensive we find that many users are mostly interested in how much is this going to cost! In this project we will create and test a QAOA algorithm and analyse its accuracy as we vary the depth and complexity of the quantum circuit to estimate the usefulness of the solution vs. the overall cost for running such an algorithm.
  ### 9. Humans vs. Quantum Computers --> *by IBM*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Humans-vs-Quantum-Computers---IBM
  > Create a working interactive ‘program’ (it can be a website, game, app, etc.) in which a human user is facing off against a quantum computer. This is broad on purpose - the program can be built in many different ways. Your program should implement strategies that seriously challenge the human player. The implementation must utilize more than just probabilities related to measuring quantum states. You must use Qiskit to program the computer’s gameplay strategy, and as much as possible, the strategy should be implemented with quantum circuits and quantum gates on real quantum hardware (although using the Simulator is understandable given the time limit).
  ### 10. Predict the orbit of the James Webb space telescope with a quantum algorithm --> *by Herman Øie Kolden*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Predict-the-orbit-of-the-James-Webb-space-telescope-with-a-quantum-algorithm---Herman-Kolden
  > This challenge takes you from start to finish in exponentially fast quantum simulation of classical physics. After demonstrating a proof-of-concept implementation in python, you explore how quantum teleportation can bridge the gap to practical applications. Finally, your creativity is tested by sketching an end-to-end application of the circuit.
  ### 11. Cryogenic Entrepreneurship Challenge --> *by Womanium*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Cryogenic-Entrepreneurship-Challenge---Womanium
  > Dilution refrigerators are in growing demand for ultra-low temperature research and applications. Develop a Dilution-Refrigerator-as-a-Service (DRaaS) business model. With this model, anyone who needs a dilution refrigerator can access it with a service model without having to buy their own. This would be analogous to provisioning servers on AWS Cloud Computing versus buying, owning and operating on-premise servers.
  ### 12. Video AI Challenge --> *by Womanium*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Video-AI-Challenge---Womanium
  > 500 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute! What determines what we watch and what disappears into the deep abyss of the internet? There is a strong competition for our eyeballs and the quality of the video, its content, format, music - everything is very important to ensure that a viewer stays and listens to a video beyond the first 5 seconds. At Womanium too, we have faced the challenge - what should we do so that the high quality lectures given during the live sessions maintains its dynamism and engagement when uploaded to Youtube? When we compared our speakers to other pre-recorded education videos on the internet, we realised one important thing we needed to correct. And this correction method took 4 minutes of every 1 minute of video to correct. Your challenge here is to automate this error correction!
  ### 13. Womanium Open Quantum & Entrepreneurship Challenge --> *by Womanium*
  https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Womanium-Quantum-Entrepreneurship-Challenge---Womanium
  > Have an idea for an opportunity where you think quantum computing can be applied? Build your own team’s challenge – technical, entrepreneurial or both!
