# Womanium-Quantum-Hackathon-2022

## Instructions:
Instructions for each team (1 to 6 people):
  1. Browse through all the challenges (given below), to get an overview on each Hackathon challenge.
  2. Visit the challenge repositories for detailed explaination of the challenges.
  3. Network with fellow participants during the Womanium Team-building events over Zoom and on Discord to find your perfect team.
  4. Finalise your team and the challenge you want to work during the Hackathon. Submit the Challenge Registeration Form with your final team and challenge by **August 5th 2022**
  5. Fork/duplicate the challenge repository of your choice (for the purposes of these instructions, this forked/duplicated repository will be referred to as your “team repository”). 
  6. Work on your team repository during the Hack period (**August 8th 2022 - August 23rd 2022**). Your repository has to be made public at the time of the Hackathon end for us to be able to judge your solutions. All work inside your team repository will be considered as the final submission for this hackathon.
  7. Please do not modify your team repository between the Judging period (**August 24th 2022 - August 25th 2022**). If you modify your team repository during this period, your submission may be subject to disqualification. 
  8. All results will be announced on **August 25th 2022, 11am-1pm US ET**.

## What should your Team Repository contain?
  1. Name of the team.
  2. Name of all team members, along with their Discord ID, Github ID, and contact email.
  3. Name of the Challenge they are participating in.
  4. A comprehensive ReadMe file which contains all the details of your hack solution.
  5. All necessary code files, pitch deck and any other information you feel is required to judge your challenge solution.
  6. Remember to submit your Team repository by submitting a PR only to the challenge repository you are working on. Final Team repositories must be made public and submitted by August 23rd 2022.
  
  
## Hackathon Challenges: 
  ### 1. Green Qupermarket (Technical Focus) --> *by Deloitte*
  > The goal of the Green Qupermarket challenge is to analyze how quantum technology can optimize the energy consumption model of supermarkets in regard to its CO2 emissions. The challenge scenario features a supermarket, multiple electric vehicles, and various weather conditions. The energy management of the supermarket is to be optimized so that the total CO2 emission is minimal by using the green decentrally generated energy out of electric vehicles. The batteries of the electric vehicles can be used as additional storage capacity.

  ### 3. Digital-analog Variational Quantum Eigensolver --> *by IQM*
  > This task is to develop a new VQE ansatz based on the digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) framework. The ansatz will combine analog evolution of the processor hamiltonian with single qubit gates placed at the right time intervals. The model has potential to be “more hardware efficient” than typical hardware efficient ansätze.
  ### 4. World-class Quantum chemistry with TKET --> *by Quantinuum*
  > Your company builds hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and is interested in finding new ways for a cost-effective and compact hydrogen storage system. You are working in the research and development (R&D) department and are tasked to evaluate the feasibility to simulate the quantum state of a Lithium Hydride (LiH) molecule using a gate-based quantum device. Based on the known gate sets and the qubit coupling map, you are tasked to find the best quantum device currently available.
  ### 5. Quantum Natural Language Processing with lambeq --> *by Quantinuum*
  > Short Description pending !!
  ### 6. Humans vs. Quantum Computers --> *by IBM*
  > Create a working interactive ‘program’ (it can be a website, game, app, etc.) in which a human user is facing off against a quantum computer. This is broad on purpose - the program can be built in many different ways. Your program should implement strategies that seriously challenge the human player. The implementation must utilize more than just probabilities related to measuring quantum states. You must use Qiskit to program the computer’s gameplay strategy, and as much as possible, the strategy should be implemented with quantum circuits and quantum gates on real quantum hardware (although using the Simulator is understandable given the time limit).
  ### 7. Random number generation using boson sampling --> *by ORCA Computing*
  > In this challenge, you will develop a true random number generator using boson sampling. You will develop a proof of concept algorithm using open-source quantum simulation packages, and then deploy your algorithm on real hardware available in the cloud.
  ### 8. Quantum approximate optimisation algorithms for real-world scenarios --> *by Strangeworks*
  > Current era noisy quantum devices may be well suited to solving quantum approximate optimisation algorithms (QAOA) which are extremely relevant to real world scenarios. As time on a quantum computer is currently extremely expensive we find that many users are mostly interested in how much is this going to cost! In this project we will create and test a QAOA algorithm and analyse its accuracy as we vary the depth and complexity of the quantum circuit to estimate the usefulness of the solution vs. the overall cost for running such an algorithm.
  ### 9. Quantum Hardware Education Challenge --> *by QWorld*
  > Develop an interactive quantum hardware module for QWorld! QWorld currently offers the comprehensive Quantum Programming modules QBronze, QSilver and QNickel. In this challenge, you will expand the QWorld curriculum with an exciting interactive module on a hardware implementation of your choice: from superconducting qubits and Qiskit Metal to topological quantum computing.
